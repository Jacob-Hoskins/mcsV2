            We all know the client gets a giddy feeling when they get updates
            about whats been done and how much closer the project is to being
            completed so we can email and message them and let them know how
            much closer you are to making their dreams come true.

            On top of the paperwork your client signs, we can send them a email
            with a conformation link so you have even more to back up what your
            side of the job is. Let us help you cover your back so it`s less of
            a worry for you and you can focus on getting the job done.

          We also aim to add a chat feature to your different jobs going on so
          you dont have to scroll through your messages and figure out whats
          what. If you need a update or a material list for a job just go to the
          chat and everyone and ask what`s needed and everyone will be notified
          of your message. Chats are going to be here to help keep the important
          messages organized for you, so you dont have to waste time going
          through your text messages.
